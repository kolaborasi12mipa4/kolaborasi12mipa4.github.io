            <h1>Aquaponic as Millennial Agriculture</h1>
            <p>Millennial farming is a modern farming system carried out by millennial farmers that brings up new ideas.
                Millennial farmers are agricultural entrepreneurs who are currently aged between 19-39 years, as the
                main target of the activity. One of the products of this millennial farm is the aquaponics system.
                Aquaponics is a modern farming system that combines hydroponic cultivation and aquaculture. That is, the
                method of farming without soil in hydroponics is combined with fish rearing techniques developed with
                aquaculture techniques.</p>
            <p>Aquaponics is an alternative to growing plants and raising fish in one container. The high rate of
                conversion of agricultural land into settlements or industrial factory areas makes the function and
                productivity that can be produced in terms of agriculture decline. By adopting this system, it is
                possible to cultivate or develop plants and fish simultaneously, in one place and at one time. Thus,
                this aquaponics system can be the answer to cultivation needs in very minimal land problems.
            </p>
            <p>Aquaponic systems are very helpful for preserving plants and fish farming. In an aquaponic system there
                is a symbiotic mutualism. Plants get their food source from fish waste. Meanwhile, fish get water as a
                place to live from water after being purified by plants. With this system, the community can cut input
                costs excessively to buy feed and nutrition for both because it is a continuous process and can be
                integrated with each other.</p>
            <p>The system has many advantages, such as aquaponics being able to produce vegetables, fruit or fish at the
                same time to meet household needs as well as for commercial purposes so that they can generate profits.
                Vegetables and fish produced from the aquaponic system have better quality and are free from chemicals
                or residues of inorganic fertilizers or chemical pesticides. In addition, the aquaponic system can save
                water used in growing vegetables and raising fish. The aquaponics system is claimed to be more water
                efficient and environmentally friendly than other planting systems because this system only uses 1/10 of
                the water used in conventional planting methods.</p>
            <p>In addition to providing benefits in meeting daily needs, aquaponics also provides psychological comfort
                for humans. Some studies say that raising and caring for fish can reduce stress and give peace of mind.
                The aquaponics system is an early innovation in creating agricultural products that are even more
                developed. With this aquaponics system, it also helps farmers and entrepreneurs in Indonesia to grow
                even more and maximize the surrounding environment. Not only that, through this system it can also help
                preserve plants and animals, especially fish and provide many benefits.
